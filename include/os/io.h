//FIXME: inline function not works, why?

//Sends a 8/16/32-bit value on a I/O location. Traditional names are outb, outw and outl respectively. The a modifier enforces val to be placed in the eax register before the asm command is issued and Nd allows for one-byte constant values to be assembled as constants, freeing the edx register for other cases.

//Receives a 8/16/32-bit value from an I/O location. Traditional names are inb, inw and inl respectively.

//Forces the CPU to wait for an I/O operation to complete. only use this when there's nothing like a status register or an IRQ to tell you the info has been received.
